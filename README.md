# KnowledgeSQL
This repository contains SQL scripts I use to practice and improve my database skills.  
Itâ€™s divided into three levels:

- **Basics**: Table creation, inserts, and simple queries  
- **Intermediate**: Joins, subqueries, grouping  
- **Advanced**: Window functions, stored procedures, triggers  

ðŸ’¡ Feel free to use these queries for practice or learning!
